## Background

The concept for this small project originated from my previous experience on Upwork, where I created two PowerPoint slides featuring a business calendar and fill-in-the-blank entries according to the client's specifications. The idea of using location-specific images was to create a visually appealing experience for the user.

Over the past two to three years, I have embarked on a programming journey, constantly seeking project ideas to expand my knowledge. I realized that transforming those two PowerPoint slides into a simple program would not only serve as a valuable learning opportunity but also provide practical benefits.
